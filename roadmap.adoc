= Color Meanings dataset + API Roadmap

== Data Collection & Scraping

=== Inspect Website


***

.Data Collection Steps
[horizontal]
1. Examine structure of site and identify HTML elements containing color names, hex codes, descriptions, or other related metadata.
2. Use Python libraries like Requests and BeautifulSoup (or Scrapy for more complex tasks) to extract data. Check site’s robots.txt and legal terms before scraping.
3. Clean and standardize data with Pandas. Save it as CSV/JSON or directly into database like SQLite or PostgreSQL.

=== Defining and Enhancing Relationships



====

.Mapping Relationships
[horizontal]
* *Containment*: color containing hues of another.
* *Associations*: thematically-linked (e.g., warm vs. cool, culturally-related, palettes, etc.).
* *Color Theory*: Complementary, analogous, triadic, etc.
* *Advanced Analysis*: using libraries like colormath or built-in colorsys to convert between color spaces and calculate similarities or complementary pairings.
* *Graph Structures*: consider a graph database (like Neo4j)

=== API Design & Implementation

***

1. Choose framework: API using FastAPI.
2. Design endpoints:
3. Fetch color details:
** Querying by relationships.
** Filtering or searching by color properties.
4. Documentation & Testing: Write clear API documentation and test endpoints with tools like Postman or curl. Containerize Docker.

=== Advanced Color Analysis with Python

1. Color Computations: advanced color analytics using:
** NumPy for numerical computations.
** Matplotlib for visualizing color distributions and relationships.
** colormath to handle color conversions and distance calculations.
2. Visualization: Generate plots to explore your color data and relationships—possibly insightful for understanding trends and patterns.

.Final Thoughts
Start small: get dataset assembled. Iteratively add API layer and build out the relationship analysis. Use Python libraries and frameworks; they’re there to help you innovate.
